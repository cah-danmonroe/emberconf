          <h2>Speaker tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure you've done a good job of integrating Ember into your talk. Sounds obvious, but it gets missed! If your talk features an app you built, it should almost always be an Ember app, for example.</li>
            <li>EmberConf has a friendly and supportive audience: they want you to succeed!</li>
            <li>You don't have to be the author of an Addon to teach the audience about it. To the contrary, you'll have a very different take on it than the author, and your take is incredibly valuable.</li>
            <li>One good idea is to deliver a talk that is an update on one given in a previous year. Past recordings are also a great place to mine for talk ideas!</li>
            <li>Some of the best talks are a combo of lived, personal experience with some takeaways. We want to hear about YOUR experience.</li>
            <li>Can you submit multiple proposals? Yes! But only one would be accepted. And you can get feedback along the way that helps you make your proposal better and better.</li>
            <li>Can you submit mini talks? Yes! It's built-in to the CFP app this year.</li>
            <li>What do you all think of talks along the lines of <em>I learned the lessons from Ember, and here's how I applied them to other frameworks (frontend or otherwise)?</em> One or two talks like this are good for the program, but be detailed! What advice are you planning to give people?</li>
            <li>How can you make sure a proposal doesnâ€™t come across as a product pitch? Try showing things that illustrate the problem rather than primarily your solution. Talk about what it is that you did to solve the problem. Talking about technical problems where the tool used Ember in new and interesting ways is helpful. Share your mental model; how to think about the problem and tools.</li>
            <li>How can an author write about their addon without identifying themselves? Hard to do. Avoid revealing personal information. But many of us have no idea who maintains what. Weâ€™ll self-regulate as we do ratings and reviews.</li>
            <li>Try to help make your talk such that everyone in the room feels included. Be welcome! Be inclusive ðŸ˜€ Empathy is often an inroad to any other topic</li>
            <li>Testing is an important topic, but consider that broad overviews have already been covered. It's better to drill down on a specific aspect.</li>
            <li>Return speakers are welcome! You can build on past talks (yours or someone else's).</li>
            <li>Are opinion talks welcome? I.e. hereâ€™s where Ember should be headed? Depends. A strong vision for a11y? Welcome! But something without RFCs and groundwork already in place is less likely to be accepted.</li>
            <li>Be careful with defensive themes to make sure itâ€™s not a negative focus. Remember, we try to be really nice! The occasional joke is ok, but avoid bashing.</li>
            <li>Youâ€™re welcome to submit talks that youâ€™ve given at other conferences and meetups. We encourage it! Iterating is the way to improve, right?</li>
